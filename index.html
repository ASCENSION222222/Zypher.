  <h1>
  The reason why Zypher is da best.
  </h1>
  <p>Now hold on here, theres quite a few reasons why i enjoy being friends with him!</p>
  <h2>
  CHAPTER 1 : The Start.
  </h2>
  <p>
  Our friendship started in TSB when I was just goofing around and met Zypher. We hit it off instantly, had a great chat, and quickly became friends. Our conversations soon became something I really looked forward to.
  </p>
  <h2>
  CHAPTER 2 : Playing.
  </h2>
  <p>
  We discovered our shared love for “The Strongest Battlegrounds.” Playing together was insanely fun. We humiliated teamers, toxics, and etc.
  </p>
  <h2>
  CHAPTER 3 : HOLY SHIT IM ON FIRE
  </h2>
  <p>
  A month or two ago, i found my passionate on quick-roasting known as "PACKING" little kids on roblox. Zypher would sometimes hit me up to roast some wrongly raisen kids.
  </p>
  <h2>
  CHAPTER 4 : Where we is.
  </h2>
  <p>
  A few days ago, Zypher stopped responding to my text (luckily he did right now.) I was worried about him. Turns out he went through a break-up a few days ago, im trying his best to comfort him and thats why im writing this.
